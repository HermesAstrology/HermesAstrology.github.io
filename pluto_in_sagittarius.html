            <p class="faq-question">What is the significance of Sagittarius in astrology?</p>
            <p>Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the zodiac, symbolized by the Archer representing truth-seeking, expansion, and philosophical exploration. As a mutable fire sign ruled by Jupiter, Sagittarius excels at seeing the bigger picture, seeking meaning, and exploring abstract concepts.

Sagittarius's evolutionary purpose involves expanding consciousness beyond personal limitations and discovering universal principles that connect humanity.

            <p class="faq-question">How does Pluto in Sagittarius differ from other Pluto placements?</p>
            <p>Pluto in Sagittarius differs significantly from other placements in its focus on ideological transformation rather than practical systems (Virgo) or relationships (Libra).
